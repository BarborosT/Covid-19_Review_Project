# Covid-19_Review_Project

- Problem definition and purpose: The data set is a Covid-19 open source data set created by the White House and leading research groups. The CORD-19 dataset represents the most comprehensive collection of coronavirus literature available. It causes difficulties for scientists to keep up with the rapid changes in the coronavirus literature. For this reason, it is aimed to develop text and data mining tools that can help the medical community develop answers to high-priority scientific questions.
